  <summary>What is Maskrom mode</summary>

Maskrom mode, also known as Loader mode, is a special boot mode generally used to restore or repair malfunctioning devices. This mode enables users to interact directly with the device's hardware without going through the operating system. In Maskrom mode, users can communicate with the device via a computer or other devices and execute a series of commands to resolve the device's issues.
