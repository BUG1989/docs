# Getting Started

## System Setup

### Powering Up Your Raspberry Pi 5

1. Insert the microSD card with the installed operating system into the Raspberry Pi 5's microSD card slot
2. Connect the [required power supply](./power-supply) to the 12V DC jack on the Radxa Dual 2.5G Router HAT
3. Wait for the system to boot completely

### Connecting to Your Raspberry Pi 5

You can connect to your Raspberry Pi 5 in one of the following ways:

#### Option 1: SSH Connection (Headless Setup)

If you enabled SSH during the system installation, you can connect remotely:

```bash
# Replace 'pi' with your username if you changed it during installation
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

If the above command doesn't work, you may need to find your Raspberry Pi's IP address on your network and use:

```bash
ssh pi@192.168.x.x  # Replace with your Raspberry Pi's actual IP address
```

#### Option 2: Direct Connection

Alternatively, you can connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse directly to your Raspberry Pi 5.

## Enabling PCIe on the Raspberry Pi 5

The PCIe interface on the Raspberry Pi 5 is disabled by default. You need to enable it for the Dual 2.5G Router HAT to function properly.

### Step 1: Edit the Configuration File

1. Open the configuration file using a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```
dtparam=pciex1
```

3. Press `Ctrl+O` to save the file, then `Ctrl+X` to exit

4. Reboot your Raspberry Pi 5:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

> **Note:** For more information, refer to the [Raspberry Pi official documentation on PCIe connectors](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-connector-for-pcie).

## Verifying Hardware Detection

### Checking PCIe Devices

After rebooting, verify that the PCIe devices on the Dual 2.5G Router HAT are properly detected:

```bash
sudo lspci
```

You should see entries for the Realtek RTL8125 Ethernet controllers and any NVMe SSD if installed:

### Checking NVMe SSD

If you've installed an NVMe SSD, verify that it's properly detected by the system:

```bash
lsblk
```

This command lists all block devices. Your NVMe SSD should appear as `nvme0n1` or similar:

#### NVMe SSD Performance Testing

You can perform a simple write speed test on your NVMe SSD using the following command:

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=1M count=1000 status=progress oflag=direct
```

> **Warning:** This command writes directly to the raw disk device. Make sure you're using the correct device name and that the SSD doesn't contain any important data.

### Optimizing PCIe Performance (Optional)

By default, the Raspberry Pi 5 may use PCIe Gen 2. For maximum performance with NVMe SSDs, you can force it to use PCIe Gen 3:

1. Edit the configuration file again:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

2. Add the following line:

```
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
```

3. Save the file and reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

4. After rebooting, verify the PCIe link status:

```bash
sudo lspci
sudo lspci -vvv -s 0000:03:00.0 | grep LnkSta
```

Look for "Speed 8GT/s" which indicates PCIe Gen 3:

5. Run the speed test again to see the improved performance:

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=1M count=1000 status=progress oflag=direct
```

### Checking Network Interfaces

Verify that both 2.5G Ethernet ports are properly detected:

```bash
ip a
```

You should see additional network interfaces (typically `eth1` and `eth2`) besides the built-in Ethernet port:

## Network Performance Testing

### Testing Ethernet Speed

To verify that your 2.5G Ethernet ports are operating at full speed, you can use the `iperf3` tool to perform network throughput tests.

#### Step 1: Install iperf3

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install iperf3
```

#### Step 2: Set Up a Test Environment

You'll need another device on your network that:

- Supports at least 2.5G Ethernet
- Has iperf3 installed
- Is connected to the same network switch that supports 2.5G or higher speeds

#### Step 3: Run the iperf3 Server

On the other device, start iperf3 in server mode:

```bash
iperf3 -s
```

#### Step 4: Run the iperf3 Client

On your Raspberry Pi 5, run iperf3 in client mode, connecting to the server:

```bash
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.100  # Replace with your server's IP address
```

You should see results showing throughput close to 2.5 Gbps if everything is configured correctly:

## Configuring Network Interfaces

You can configure the network interfaces permanently by editing the network configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

### Example Static IP Configuration

Add the following lines to assign static IPs to your network interfaces:

```
interface eth1
static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8

interface eth2
static ip_address=192.168.2.100/24
```

Save the file and reboot for the changes to take effect.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PCIe devices not detected**

   - Ensure the PCIe is enabled in config.txt
   - Check that the FPC cable is properly connected
   - Verify that the 12V power supply is connected

2. **Network interfaces not working**

   - Check network cable connections
   - Verify switch/router supports 2.5G speeds
   - Try updating the kernel: `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`

3. **NVMe SSD not detected**
   - Ensure the SSD is properly seated in the M.2 slot
   - Try a different SSD to rule out compatibility issues
   - Check kernel logs: `dmesg | grep -i nvme`

## Next Steps

Now that your Radxa Dual 2.5G Router HAT is properly configured, you can use it for various applications such as:

- Setting up a high-performance router or firewall
- Creating a network-attached storage (NAS) solution
- Building a media server with fast network connectivity
- Developing edge computing applications requiring high-speed networking
