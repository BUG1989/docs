  2. When the system recognises the Penta SATA HAT, you can see the SATA devices (sda/sdb/sdc/sdd).

- Software Support

  1. We provide an installation script to help you install the software we provide that enables the Penta top panel to display messages and control fans.

  Simply copy the command above and paste it into the terminal and press enter.

  2. Software Configuration

  Edit /etc/rockpi-penta.conf, and use the following command to make it effective.

  ```
  sudo systemctl restart rockpi-penta.service
