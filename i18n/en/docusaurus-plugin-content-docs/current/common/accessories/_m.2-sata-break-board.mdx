- Installation

  1. Preparation

  When using the M2.E to SATA adapter board, you need to prepare a SATA cable for connecting the SATA hard drive and a SATA power cable for power supply.

  2. Connect

  As shown in the picture, connect the M.2 E key of the SATA adapter board to the M.2 E port of {props.product}, and then use the SATA cable to connect {props.product} to the SATA SSD.
  The red PIN pin of {props.product} can be used for SATA 5V power supply, and the black PIN pin is usually used for GND, which can be used for SATA HDD power supply.

  3. Enable SATA Overlay

  Open a terminal and run rsetup

  <img
    src="/img/common/rsetup/main_menu.webp"
    alt="main menu"
    style={{ width: "60%" }}
  />

  Select `Manage overlays`:

  <img
    src="/img/common/rsetup/mannage_overlays.webp"
    alt="manage overlays"
    style={{ width: "60%" }}
  />

  Select by space <strong> {props.rsetup_sata_title} </strong>

  <img src={props.rsetup_sata_img} alt="rsetup sata" style={{ width: "60%" }} />

  4. Press <strong>ESC</strong> to exit rsetup and reboot the system.

- Check if the SATA is mounted successfully

  See if the SSD is recognised with the `lsblk` command

  <pre>
    radxa@{props.model}:~$ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0
    0 476.9G 0 disk mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.5G 0 disk ├─mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 16M 0 part
    /config └─mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 14.4G 0 part / mmcblk0boot0 179:32 0 4M 1 disk
    mmcblk0boot1 179:64 0 4M 1 disk zram0 254:0 0 3.9G 0 disk [SWAP]
  </pre>

  When SATA is recognised by the system, it can be viewed as **sda**
