- Repeatedly unplugging peripherals

  Repeatedly plug and unplug the USB peripherals to ensure that they are recognised and work properly every time.

  1. Identify the mouse and keyboard

    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub Bus 002
    Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub Bus 003 Device 001:
    ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
    <strong>Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0000:3825 USB OPTICAL MOUSE</strong>
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1a40:0101 Terminus Technology Inc. Hub Bus 001 Device
    001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
  </pre>

  As shown above, the mouse (USB OPTICAL MOUSE) and keyboard (usb keyboard) have been successfully recognised here.

  2. Identify the storage device.

  <pre>
    lsusb Bus 008 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub Bus 007
    Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    <strong>

      Reader
    </strong>
    Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub Bus 005
    Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub Bus 004 Device 001:
    ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002
    Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux
    Foundation 1.1 root hub Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1a40:0101 Terminus Technology
    Inc. Hub Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
  </pre>

  As shown above, the Micro-SD Card Reader has been successfully recognised here.

- Waking up peripherals

  1. After 10 minutes of hibernation, operate the USB peripherals, such as keyboard and mouse, to see if the system wakes up normally.

  2. Enter the account password, log in to the system, check whether the peripheral devices are waking up and working properly, such as WIFI, sound card, etc.

  3. Operate three times

  Note: USB OTG port detection

- Transmission Rate

  1. Identify the USB memory device

  Confirm USB memory device via lsblk

  <img
    src={props.usb_dev_img}
    alt="pwm fan result img"
    style={{ width: "80%" }}
  />

  As shown above, the USB storage device inserted into {props.product} is /dev/{props.usb_dev}.

  2. Read test

  <pre>
    radxa@{props.model}:~$ sudo dd if=/dev/{props.usb_dev} of=/dev/null bs=1M
    count=100 100+0 records in 100+0 records out 104857600 bytes (105 MB, 100
    MiB) copied, {props.usb_dev_sd_read_time}, {props.usb_dev_sd_read_speed}
  </pre>

  This command will read data from the USB device and write it to /dev/null in order to test the read speed. The block size specified here is 1M, and 100 blocks are specified to be read, so a total of 100 MB of data is read at {props.usb_dev_sd_read_speed}.

  3. Write Test

  <pre>
    radxa@{props.model}:~$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/{props.usb_dev} bs=1M
    count=100 100+0 records in 100+0 records out 104857600 bytes (105 MB, 100
    MiB) copied, {props.usb_dev_sd_write_time}, {props.usb_dev_sd_write_speed}
  </pre>

  The block size specified here is 1M, 100 blocks were written, a total of 100 M of data was written, and the write speed was {props.usb_dev_sd_write_speed}.
