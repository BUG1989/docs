## Using bsp

bsp is a set of tools provided by Radxa to quickly build U-Boot Kernels. It is very easy to build your own U-Boot and Kernel with bsp.

<PreView params={{ model: props.model }}>
The following shows you how to build a kernel with bsp using #props.model# as an example.
</PreView>

### bsp environment configuration

The following is the recommended environment for `bsp`.  
Hardware: x86_64 PC recommended  
System: Ubuntu or Debian

#### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git qemu-user-static binfmt-support

# Podman (recommended)
sudo apt install -y podman podman-docker
sudo touch /etc/containers/nodocker
# Docker
# sudo apt install docker.io

# Optional dependencies for minor features
sudo apt install -y systemd-container
```

#### Getting the code

`bsp` uses the git submodule. Therefore, use the following command to get the code:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/radxa-repo/bsp.git
```

#### Understanding `bsp` usage

Once you have the `bsp` code on your machine, you can run `bsp` to see the built-in help:

```bash
cd bsp
. /bsp
```

### Build the kernel

<PreView params={{ model: props.model, soc: props.soc }}>
  {`
Once you've finished configuring your bsp environment, you need to compile the kernel once before pulling the kernel code from the repository.  
Running . /bsp will show you all the arguments and their explanations, and the command "bsp [options] <linux|u-boot> <profile> [product]" will be available at the prompt.  
Taking #model# as an example, the linux profile is "#soc#". The following are profiles for other products:
| model | profile |
| :--------------: | :------: |
| Radxa ROCK 5A | rockchip |
| Radxa ROCK 5B | rockchip | Radxa ROCK 5B | rockchip | Radxa ROCK 5B | rockchip
Radxa ROCK 5A | rockchip | Radxa ROCK 5B | rockchip | Radxa ROCK 5C | rockchip |
Radxa ROCK 5B | rockchip | Radxa ROCK 5C | rockchip | Radxa ROCK 5 ITX | rockchip |
| Radxa ROCK 3A | rk356x | Radxa ROCK 3A | rk356x | Radxa ROCK 3A | rk356x
| Radxa ROCK 3C | rk356x | Radxa CM3 Series
Radxa ROCK 3A | rk356x | Radxa ROCK 3C | rk356x | Radxa ROCK 3C | rk356x
| Radxa ROCK PI S | stable | Radxa ROCK 3C | rk356x | Radxa CM3 series | rk356x
Then fill in the **profile** parameter of the bsp command with the product profile **#soc#** e.g.: **. /bsp linux #soc#** to build the kernel.  
The kernel source code is located in **.src/linux** in the bsp directory, and you can build the kernel again after modifying the kernel source code:
`}
</PreView>

<PreView params={{ soc: props.soc }}>
  {`
    cd bsp
    . /bsp --no-prepare-source linux #soc# -r 20
    Parameter description:
    --no-prepare-source # Compile with local changes, without this parameter the latest code will be synchronized from the Radxa kernel repository and overwrite the local changes.
    -r 20 # Specify the kernel version as 20.
`}
</PreView>

After compilation, a number of `deb` packages will be generated in the current directory, you only need to install the following two `deb` packages

<PreView params={{ soc: props.soc }}>
  {`
    linux-headers-5.10.160-20-#soc#_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
    linux-image-5.10.160-20-#soc#_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
`}
</PreView>

Copy the above two `deb` packages to the board and install them with the `dpkg` command to complete the kernel installation

<PreView params={{ soc: props.soc }}>
  {`
    sudo dpkg -i linux-image-5.10.160-20-#soc#_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-5.10.160-20-#soc#_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
    sudo reboot
`}
</PreView>

After the reboot is complete, you can check if the installation was successful by checking the version number of the currently booted kernel with `uname -a`.

## Compile manually

:::tip
`bsp` is the only compilation method currently being maintained, and it makes additional changes to the source code when compiling.
If you want to develop based on our officially released software, you should at least use `bsp` to download and configure the code.

If you want to build with a custom `make` command, please refer to the [Prepare working tree](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/dev_flow.html#prepare-working-tree) section to configure the code.
