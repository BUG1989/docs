## Idea:

* Get an SD card or eMMC to act as a boot disk

* Use system tool rsetup to brush SPI

* Brush the system image to the NVME SSD

* Unplug the SD card /eMMC and boot from NVME

### Get an SD card or eMMC to act as a boot disk

Here the SD card /eMMC function is equivalent to x86 boot disk, the purpose is to get SPi.img, spI.img brush into the spi flash. After booting from the SD card /eMMC, execute the following command to update the system:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get full-upgrade
```

### Use system tool rsetup to brush SPI

### Brush the system image to the NVME SSD

Verify that the NVME is recognized by the system and copy the system image to the current system (for example, the following path is /home/radxa).

```
sudo xzcat /home/radxa/rock-3c_debian_bullseye_xfce_b42.img.xz | dd of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=1M status=progress
```

### Unplug SD card /eMMC and boot from NVME
