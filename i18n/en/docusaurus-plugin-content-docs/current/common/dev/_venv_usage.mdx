In the Radxa OS system, installing Python libraries via `pip3` is restricted by the system. Users can use a virtual environment to isolate the virtual environment from the system environment.

```bash
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
```

### Install Virtual Environment

Using Python 3.11 as an example:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.11-venv
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Upgrade pip

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

```bash
deactivate
```
