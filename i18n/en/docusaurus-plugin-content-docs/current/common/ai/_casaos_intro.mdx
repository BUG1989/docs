### CasaOS Installation Method

:::tip
Factory installed, Reference only
:::

#### Docker Update Method

- Check the current Docker version

  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

- If the version is lower than 24.0.7, uninstall Docker

  ```bash
  for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
  ```

- Configure Docker apt repository

  ```bash
  # Add Docker's official GPG key:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
  sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
  sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

  # Add the repository to Apt sources:
  echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

- Download the pre-downloaded deb package for the new version (it is necessary to manually install the latest Docker)

  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/radxa-edge/TPU-Edge-AI/releases/download/v0.1.0/Docker_Naspackage.zip
  unzip Docker_Naspackage.zip

  cd Docker_Naspackage
  sudo apt install ./*.deb
  ```

- Install the new Docker version

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
  ```

#### Docker Image Directory Migration

Since Docker is installed in the root directory by default, pulling images will install them in `/var/lib/docker`, which can easily fill up the root directory.

Here, we will describe how to use symbolic links to move the Docker folder to a larger capacity disk (strongly recommended to do this immediately after installing Docker).

- Check the current disk space on the host

  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

  ![store.webp](/img/general-tutorial/tpu_ai/store.webp)

  Here we see that the `/data` directory has sufficient space (use a directory with more space if available). In this case, we use `/data`.

- Move `/var/lib/docker` to the target directory (`/data`) using a superuser

  ```bash
  sudo su
  mv /var/lib/docker /data
  ```

- Create a symbolic link using a superuser

  ```bash
  ln -s /data/docker /var/lib
  ```

  The symbolic link is now created. Use the command `ls -l /var/lib/docker` to check the link address.

  ```bash
  $ ls -l /var/lib/docker
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Dec 20 17:42 /var/lib/docker -> /data/docker
  ```

#### CasaOS Installation

- Check the current Docker version. If the version is lower than 24.0.7, uninstall and update it. Docker update method can be found [here](#docker-update-method).

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash
  ```

- Follow the installation guide

  ![casaos_install.webp](/img/general-tutorial/tpu_ai/casaos_install.webp)

  If the root directory space is less than 5GB, you can still proceed with the installation by entering 1 for a forced installation.

- Access CasaOS through the 81 port of the Airbox IP. The first visit will require account creation.
