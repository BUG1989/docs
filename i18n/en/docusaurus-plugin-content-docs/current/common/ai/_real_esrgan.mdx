Real-ESRGAN-TPU: Video/Image Resolution Upscaling Application. This application uses the open-source [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) series of models from Tencent ARC Lab, transplanted to the SG2300X series of chip products using the Sophon SDK, enabling hardware-accelerated inference with local TPU. This application can upscale video/image resolution to 2560x1920 pixels and provides multiple optimized models for different scenarios, enabling targeted optimization for real-world scenes and anime videos.

Includes real face enhancement models: [CodeFormer](https://github.com/sczhou/CodeFormer) and [GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN).
Includes [RMBG](https://github.com/chenxwh/cog-RMBG) for background removal, allowing DIY backgrounds (e.g., ID photo backgrounds). This application uses Gradio to achieve a user-friendly interactive interface.

### Application Installation

- Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zifeng-radxa/Real-ESRGAN-tpu_Web.git
  ```

- Clone the face enhancement toolbox

  ```bash
  cd Real-ESRGAN-tpu_Web
  git clone https://github.com/zifeng-radxa/FACEXLIB.git
  ```

- Create a virtual environment

  **You must create a virtual environment to avoid impacting the normal operation of other applications.** Refer to [this guide](../ai-tools/virtualenv_usage) for virtual environment usage.

  ```bash
  python3 -m virtualenv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Download dependencies

  ```bash
  pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  pip3 install https://github.com/radxa-edge/TPU-Edge-AI/releases/download/v0.1.0/tpu_perf-1.2.31-py3-none-manylinux2014_aarch64.whl
  ```

- Download models

  ```bash
  python3 download_models.py
  ```

- Start the application

  - Start with Gradio

  ```bash
  bash run_gr.sh
  ```

  Access the application through port 7860 of the Airbox IP address in your browser.
