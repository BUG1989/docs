## 2.Flash SD card

We need to flash the corresponding complete image in RK format.

Complete image in RK format refers to **The `update.img` image compiled using a series of Linux SDKs released by Rockchip based on Buildroot**

Open the executable file `SD_Firmware_Tool.exe` of SDDiskTool and insert the SD card.

:::warning
When multiple storage devices are connected, please ensure you select the correct SD card to flash, otherwise other storage devices may be overwritten.
:::

Select the SD card to flash from the removable disk devices, choose **SD Boot** as the function mode, ensure that the firmware upgrade is a complete image in RK format, and finally click **Create** to flash the image.

Please be patient during the flashing process. The image contains many partitions, and if the image is large, the flashing time will be longer.
