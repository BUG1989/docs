### Change Language Input Method

Debian systems come with only the English input method by default. If you need an input method for another language, you need to install it separately. Here, we will use the installation of Pinyin as an example

#### Environment Configuration

If your Debian environment is not in Chinese, you need to switch to the Chinese environment. You can switch using the following command, then enter the user password.

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Press the spacebar or Enter to select OK and prepare for the next step of the installation.

Run the following commands to update and install the system environment software:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

#### Install the fcitx Chinese input method

1.  Open the command terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install fcitx  # Enter 'Y' to install the package.
```

2.  Execute the command to install the Chinese input method you need, then enter the user password.

```bash
sudo apt install fcitx-googlepinyin  # Enter 'Y' to install the package.
```

After the installation is successful, please restart the computer. A keyboard icon will appear in the taskbar.
