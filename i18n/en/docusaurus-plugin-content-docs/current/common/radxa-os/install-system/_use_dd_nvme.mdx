This guide explains how to use the `dd` command to install the system onto an NVMe SSD.

:::warning
Installing the system will format the NVMe SSD. Please back up any important data in advance!
:::

## Prerequisites

To use the `dd` command to install the system onto an NVMe SSD, you need to meet the following conditions:

- The system can boot normally from another storage device (recommended: boot from a MicroSD card)
- NVMe SSD is properly installed on the motherboard

## Hardware Connection

You can proceed based on your motherboard configuration.

:::tip
This tutorial is applicable to multiple motherboards. Choose the appropriate steps for hardware connection based on your motherboard configuration.

There are two scenarios for installing an NVMe SSD on the motherboard:

- Motherboard has an M.2 M Key interface: You can directly install the NVMe SSD
- Motherboard doesn't have an M.2 M Key interface but has a PCIe FPC interface: You can install the NVMe SSD using a PCIe to M.2 M Key HAT module

## System Installation

### Download System Image

Access the resource summary download page from the motherboard and download the system image file locally.

:::tip Image Note
The downloaded system image is a compressed file and needs to be extracted before use!
:::

#### Recommended Download Methods

- Direct Download

Access the resource summary download page directly from the motherboard and download the system image file locally.

- Download using wget command

Download the system image file locally using the `wget` command from the motherboard.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt install wget -y
wget <url>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<url>` is the download link of the system image file. You can replace it by copying the download link from the resource summary download page.

- Download from PC

Access the resource summary download page from a PC, download the system image file, and then transfer it to the motherboard using a USB drive, FTP, SCP, etc.

#### Extract System Image

Our system images are typically in `*.img.xz` format and need to be extracted before use.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xz-utils -y
unxz <image_path>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<image_path>` is the path to the system image file. Replace it with the actual path to your system image file.

### Install System Image

Use the `dd` command to install the system image onto the NVMe SSD.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo dd if=<image_path> of=<device_target> bs=4M status=progress
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Parameter Description:

- `<image_path>`: Path to the system image file. Replace with the actual path to your system image file.
- `<device_target>`: Device path of the NVMe SSD. Replace with the actual device path of your NVMe SSD.
- `bs=4M`: Block size for writing.
- `status=progress`: Show progress during writing.

:::tip Determining Device Path

You can use the `lsblk` command to view device paths and identify the correct one based on disk capacity.

Note: If disk capacities are similar, you can safely power off the motherboard, remove and reinsert the NVMe SSD, and observe which device path appears and disappears to determine the correct one.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>
