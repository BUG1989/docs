# eMMC Module

The Radxa eMMC module utilizes the eMMC 5.1 specification and offers four capacity options: 16g/32g/64g/128g. Meanwhile, you can choose a model that supports industrial-grade long life. In addition, the module supports JEDEC's standard eMMC command set and is designed for high-speed read/write for faster data transfer.

## Read/write speed test

The eMMC chip's we use are Foresee, made by Longsys, a Shenzhen-based embedded storage company who acquired the Lexar brand in 2017.

Here are the tests we did on different brands of eMMC chips.
