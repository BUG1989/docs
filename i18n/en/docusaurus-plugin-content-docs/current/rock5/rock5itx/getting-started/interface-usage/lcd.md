#### Overview

The Radxa Display 8 HD is a colour active matrix LCD module with touchscreen, designed for Radxa single board computers.
This 8.0-inch display allows you to create interactive projects such as tablet PCs, industrial HMIs, information dashboards, and more. With a single cable for power, display, and touch, as well as an enabled software on-screen keyboard, the Radxa Display 8 HD gives you a complete HMI without the need to connect a keyboard or mouse.
In addition, the built-in sensors on the display can be used for automatic portrait or landscape rotation. It has the following features:

- 8.0-inch LCD display
- 800 x 1280, 16.7M colour resolution
- Full viewing angle LCD
- 5-point capacitive touchscreen
- Supports PWM brightness control
