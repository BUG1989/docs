## Software Support

We provide an installation script to help you install the software we provide that enables the Penta top panel to display information and control fans.

```
curl -sL https://rock.sh/get-rockpi-penta | sudo -E bash -

Simply copy the above command and paste it into the terminal and press enter.

### Software configuration

Edit /etc/rockpi-penta.conf, and enable it with the following command.
