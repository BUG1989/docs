The Radxa X4 integrates an Intel N100 CPU and a [RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040) MCU, which communicate with each other via USB or UART.
The 40-PIN interface serves as an I/O expansion port extending from the RP2040 microcontroller. The CPU exerts control over this interface through communication with the RP2040,
which leverages the Pico SDK for efficient manipulation and operation of the 40-PIN interface.
