# Preparation

## Preparations Before Use

### Power Supply

Radxa X4 recommends using a power adapter that supports the USB Type-C PD protocol (supports 12V and the current >= 2.5A under 12V), but it does not support the Qualcomm QC protocol.

Radxa recommends using [Radxa Power PD30W](../accessories/pd-30w).

### Monitor

In order to support an HDMI display, you will need an additional Micro HDMI to HDMI cable.

### Network Connection

### USB Mouse

### USB Keyboard

### Heatsink

:::tip
To ensure the stable operation of the Radxa X4, it is essential to equip it with a heatsink. Without proper cooling, the device may experience high temperatures, which could negatively impact performance and even lead to system instability.
