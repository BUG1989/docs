:::tip
This image is a unified image for the ROCK 2 series and supports the following devices based on the RK3528A:

- E20C
- ROCK 2A
- ROCK 2F

These devices are equipped with distinct Board IDs at the hardware level. During the boot phase, the bootloader reads the corresponding hardware description (device tree) based on the Board ID, thereby allocating system resources to enable a single firmware to be compatible with multiple hardware devices.
