# Installing System to NVMe SSD

M.2 NVMe SSD is a high-speed, high-capacity, and cost-effective storage device that offers faster read/write speeds compared to MicroSD cards and UFS modules. It's an excellent choice for users looking to further enhance their system's read/write and boot performance.

We provide two methods to install the system on an M.2 NVMe SSD:

- For users who have an M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure, the installation process is similar to that of installing the system on a MicroSD card and is relatively straightforward.

- For users without an M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure, you can use the `dd` command to install the system image to the M.2 NVMe SSD.

The Radxa ROCK 4D comes with an FPC interface that provides PCIe Gen2 Ã—1 channel expansion capability.

To use the FPC interface, you'll need to purchase a PCIe to M.2 M Key HAT in advance and install it correctly according to the accessory instructions.
