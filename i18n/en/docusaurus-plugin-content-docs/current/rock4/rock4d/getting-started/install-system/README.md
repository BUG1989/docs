# Install System

Radxa ROCK 4D supports three ways to install the system: MicroSD card, UFS module, and M.2 NVMe SSD. Users can choose the corresponding system startup medium based on their needs.

- Use MicroSD card to install the system - Simple operation, just need a card reader to complete the system installation; but the read and write speed is slower than UFS module and M.2 NVMe SSD card.

- Use UFS module to install the system - Compared with MicroSD card, the read and write speed is faster, and Radxa ROCK 4D supports pluggable UFS modules, and you can refer to the [Radxa UFS Module](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/ufs-module) for more information.

- Use M.2 NVMe SSD to install the system - Compared with UFS module, the read and write speed is faster, but it needs to be used with a special adapter.

Overall, if there is no high requirement for read and write performance, you can use MicroSD card as the system startup medium; if there is a requirement for read and write speed and does not need to connect Radxa ROCK 4D with an additional adapter, you can use UFS module to install the system; if there is a higher requirement for read and write speed, you can use M.2 NVMe SSD to install the system.
