# Radxa System

Radxa System, also known as Radxa OS, is an open-source operating system independently developed by the Radxa team based on the Debian Linux distribution. Radxa OS not only integrates numerous peripherals and practical system software to meet daily office, study, and entertainment needs, but the Radxa team has also developed Rsetup, a convenient system configuration tool that further simplifies the user operation process.
