To start using ROCK 2A, you will also need the following equipment:

- A 5V/2A power adapter (ROCK 2A only supports 5V input; you can use a PD power adapter that supports 5V). For more details on power supply options, please refer to the [Power Solutions].(./power-supply)ã€‚
- An HDMI cable and an HDMI-compatible monitor, with a recommended resolution of 1080P or higher. A 4K monitor will provide the best experience.
- A USB mouse and keyboard. Common USB input devices are plug-and-play compatible.

## Installing the Operating System
